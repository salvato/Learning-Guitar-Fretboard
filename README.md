# Learning-Guitar-Fretboard
This is a simple App to learn the note positions on a guitar fretboard (Standard Tuning only at the moment).

The App allow to choose a string and shows a random note on the staff that the guitarist should play.


When the guitarist play the correct note, the score increments and a new random note will be shown on the staff.


There is an option to show the note name on the staff to help beginners to learn how to read the staff.

The time elapsed from the start is also shown to measure the learning progresses.
