# Learning-Guitar-Fretboard

This is a simple App (using Qt version 6.4.0) aimed to help learning the note positions on a guitar fretboard
(Standard Tuning only at present).

The App has been tested on Ubuntu and on an Android Tablet.
It should work also on Windows (not yet tested however).

The App allow to choose a string and shows a random note on the staff that the guitarist should play.

When the guitarist play the correct note, the score increments and a new random note will be shown
on the staff.

There is an option to show the note name on the staff to help beginners to learn how to read the staff.

The time elapsed from the start is also shown to measure the learning progresses.
