# Learning-Guitar-Fretboard
This is a simple App to learn the note position on a guitar fretboard (Standard Tuning only at the moment).
The App allow to choose a string and shows a random note on the staff that the guitarist should play.
When the guitar play the corresponding note, the score increments and a new random note will be shown on the staff.
There is an option to show the note name on the staff to help newcomers to learn how to read the staff.
